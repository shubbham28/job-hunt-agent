Background: This post is part of the OpenCLIM_LANDS project, that aims at providing the insights needed to put the UK on a path to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, achieved through climate resilient soil health, food security, and biodiversity net gain. In this multi-centre project, we will combine climate forecasting with latest advances in soil science to enable a unique perspective into land use under forecasted climate change scenarios. The role: In this post, we will address the following questions: How do soil microbes establish, contribute and maintain healthy, biodiverse macro- & micro-communities, and how are these impacted by different land use scenarios? How can we use machine learning to predict soil microbiomes from either pristine or agriculturally used soils, predict their functional capacity (e.g. carbon storage)? What practices can help microbial soil communities recover? To answer these and more questions the OpenCLIM_LANDS multi-centre project was established. The project holder will use metagenomics (similar to doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0386-6, 10.1111/1462-2920.15314) to profile both taxonomic and functional compositions of >3,000 newly sequenced soil sites. Using machine learning we will build comprehensive profiles of typically expected microbial profiles across soil sites (similar to doi: 10.1016/j.chom.2023.05.024) and their relation to soil health and carbon storage. Using a combination of robotics and third-generation sequencing, we will use predictive microbial modelling to improve land use on existing agricultural sites. Long-term, this work will enable microbially-informed agriculture, combating the impact of climate change and understanding how healthy soil microbiomes are established & maintained. The environment: The Hildebrand group uses metagenomics to research the diversity, community interactions, and evolution of microbes in communities using custom software solutions. The Quince group explores environmental and host-associated microbiomes using statistics and machine learning. Both groups are situated at the Norwich Research Park (NRP) UK, that integrates the 4 BBSRC Institutes, University of East Anglia (UEA), > 15 companies, 3,000 researchers and clinicians, and 17,000 students. Norwich ranked in the top 10 of UK cities with a historical town centre and an active food & coffee aficionado scene.
