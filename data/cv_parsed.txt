Sheepdog Algorithm​
Jan 2021 - Jun 2021 
●​
Developed the Sheepdog Algorithm, a bio-inspired metaheuristic feature selection tool inspired by sheepdog herding 
behavior that reduces dimensionality by balancing low feature count and high accuracy. 
●​
Integrated the algorithm with multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) in 
Python for dynamic feature pruning, achieving a 10% improvement in predictive performance through rigorous 
benchmarking and A/B testing on real-world biomedical datasets. 
●​
Presented the innovative Sheepdog Algorithm to over 200 professionals at major European and international 
conferences, showcasing its novel research findings.

Survival Analysis of clinical mastitis​
April 2020 - Aug 2020 
●​
Identified key risk factors for mastitis by applying Cox regression models, mixed-effects models, and L1 
penalization, revealing the most influential covariates affecting the hazard of infection. 
●​
Enhanced early detection strategies for mastitis by estimating survival curves and evaluating model fit through 
residual analysis, thereby contributing to better disease management protocols.​
