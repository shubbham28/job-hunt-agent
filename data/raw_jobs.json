The Next Frontierof Machine Reasoning: Web-scale Knowledge Graph Exploration usingReinforcement Learning Human experts can form and explorestructured mental models in their heads to solve open-endedproblems across different domains. Our research seeks to emulatethis process through a novel combination of using reinforcementlearning agents to perform exploration through a knowledge graph.Knowledge graphs allow us to represent structured information andthe logical relations that govern it, unlocking the ability tobuild reinforcement learning strategies that can learn to solvecomplex, open-ended problems across web-scale andcontinuously-evolving domains. You will be leading the research onknowledge representation and how it can serve to build AI systemscapable of such complex reasoning. You will work on formulatingresearch problems that explore how Reinforcement Learningalgorithms can interact with large and complex knowledge graphs toreason over ambiguous tasks. To do this, you will develop knowledgegraph machine learning techniques that will power several toolswithin our products. Knowledge graph representations (e.g.embeddings) are critical to representing web-scale, structuredinformation in a compact format for a reinforcement learning agent,ensuring scalability. You will lead the efforts on training andvalidating graph embedding algorithms that capture multi-hopsemantics within large web-scale knowledge graphs.
